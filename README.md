# monarch-menswear-website
A project-based website for Monarch Menswear, featuring 5 developed webpages showcasing the brand and products. This website was created as part of a college project and is no longer under active development.

Monarch Menswear, a responsive e-commerce website, designed and developed, tailored for modern men’s fashion, combining sleek aesthetics with intuitive functionality. The project involved end-to-end execution—from wireframing in Figma to full-stack development using HTML, CSS, and frontend best practices—resulting in a seamless shopping experience across desktop and mobile devices.

Key Features & Achievements:
1. User-Centric Design: Crafted a clean, grid-based layout with a minimalist color scheme (#000000, #FFFFFF, #F0F0F0) and elegant typography (Italiana, Inria Serif) to align with the brand’s premium identity.
2. Responsive Experience: Ensured fluid adaptability across devices using a 12-column (desktop) and 4-column (mobile) grid system, optimizing navigation for all users.
3. Interactive Elements: Implemented hover animations, dynamic product galleries, and streamlined CTAs (Add to Bag, Wishlist) to enhance engagement.
4. E-Commerce Functionality: Developed key pages including Product Detail, Shopping Bag, and Wishlist, integrated with mock payment gateways for a realistic user flow.
5. Testing & Validation: Conducted usability tests to validate navigation, responsiveness, and accessibility, achieving 100% pass rates on core workflows (e.g., checkout, login).

Technical Stack:
Figma (Wireframing, Prototyping) | HTML5 | CSS3 | Responsive Design Principles

Impact & Future Scope:
1. Addressed core business objectives: brand trust, user retention, and mobile accessibility.
2. Future enhancements: Backend integration (Node.js/Python), AI-driven recommendations, and customer review systems.
